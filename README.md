## Computer Architecture Final Project

###FINAL GROUP PROJECT:  CPU DESIGN PART I:  LANGUAGE DESIGN (DUE: 4/17/14)
*Tentative Dates set to each section*

#### 1.1 PROCESSORS OF THE WORLD COMPARISON (Have this done by Monday, 4/14)
*Neat, Compared 4 processors architecture, machine code, and assembly language with an excellent comparison and discussion of pros and cons of each processor.*

 * Michael: Old Style Intel Architecture
 * Tommy: Modern General Purpose MIPS Architecture
 * Jonathan: Modern General Purpose ARM Architecture 
 * Hannah:  Modern Application Specific Nvidia Fermi Architecture

What to compare: 

1.	<b>Data Path Units</b> – Write a paragraph describing the Data Path Unit architecture for each processor. How do the DPUs compare one to another?

2.	<b>Instruction Format Comparisons</b> – Pick two instructions: Pick a branch instruction and one other instruction. Compare the assembly and machine code format for both of these instructions among all 4 processors.


#### 1.2 PROGRAMMERS VIEW OF THE ARCHITECTURE (4/14)

#### 1.3 TWO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE TEST PROGRAMS (4/15)

#### 1.4 HEXADECIMAL MACHINE CODE LISTINGS  (4/16)

####10 bonus pts possible: ASSEMBLER PROGRAM (4/17?)
*If time is available
