Applying constraints in "test1.ucf" to the design...
INFO:NgdBuild:738 - A case sensitive search for the INST, PAD, or NET element
   referred to by a constraint entry in 'test1.ucf' that accompanies this design
   has failed, while a case insensitive search is in progress. The result of the
   case insensitive search will be used, but messages will accompany each and
   every use of a case insensitive result. Constraints are case sensitive with
   respect to user-specified identifiers, which includes names of logic elements
   in a design.
INFO:NgdBuild:740 - "test1.ucf" Line 16: Found case insensitive match for NET
   name 'Reset1'. NET is 'reset1'.
