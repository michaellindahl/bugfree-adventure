#Modern General Purpose MIPS Architecture

1.	<b>Data Path Units</b> – Write a paragraph describing the Data Path Unit architecture for each processor. How do the DPUs compare one to another?

<b>Major Components:</b>
	a. PC (program counter)
	b. Instruction Memory
	c. Register File
	d. ALU (arithmetic and logic unit)
	e. memory
	f. Control Unit
	
The processor starts by fetching instruction from memory. The instruction is then sent to the register file, in which bits 25-21 are connected to the address input of one of the register file read ports. Instruction bits 15 down to 0 are sign-extended (or zero-extended by later implementation and depending on the instruction type) to 32 bits. An ALU is ready to receive two operands, a SrcA, from the register file, and SrcB, which comes from the sign-extended immediate. An ALU Control determines the operation to be used. The outcome of this ALU is ALUResult, is then sent to the Data Memory. From here, the data is read from data memory onto a ReadData bus, which is written back to the destination register in the register file. During this process and cycling, the processor must compute the address of the next instruction, thus another adder is implemented to increment the program counter by 4. Another bus known as WriteData, is also sent to Data Memory if there is a store operation. As a result, ReadData is ignored. Adding basic instructions such as add, sub, an, or, and slt require datapath enhancements involving more muxes to determine which type of instruction is being used and which should be entered into the ALU. A memory to register mux is also available to determine whether or not ReadData or ALUResult is active. Other instructions yet again, such as branch and jump require additional datapath enhancements as well. A control unit computes the control signals based on the opcode and funct fields of the instruction bits. Based on the instruction specified, this CU controls the muxes within the datapath. Within the control unit contains the main decoder and ALU decoder. 

Weaknesses: 
	1. Requires long clock cycle to support slowest instruction
	2. Requires three adders (expensive)
	3. Separate instruction and data memoreis (unrealistic)

2.	<b>Instruction Format Comparisons</b> – Pick two instructions: Pick a branch instruction and one other instruction. Compare the assembly and machine code format for both of these instructions among all 4 processors.

	1. beq instruction (J-type): 
		a. assembly:  beq rs, rt, label
		b. machine:   [opcode (6 bits)][RS (5 bits)][RT (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]
						opcode = 000100
		c. operation: if ([rs]==[rt]) PC=JTA (jump target address)
	2. add instruction (R-type):
		a. assembly:  add rd, rs, rt 
		b. machine:   [op (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][shamt (5 bits)][funct (6 bits)]
						op, shamt = 0, funct = 100000
		c. operation: [rd]=[rs]+[rt]
