#Old Style Intel 8080 Architecture

####**Data Path Units** – Write a paragraph describing the Data Path Unit architecture for each processor. How do the DPUs compare one to another?

The Intel 8080 is mainly an 8-bit processor, however, it can do some 16-bit operations. The 8080 has seven 8-bit registers, where six of them are sometimes combined to form 3 16-bit registers. It has a 16-bit stack pointer and a 16-bit program counter. The 8080 has 5 internal flag bits: Sign, Zero, Parity, Carry and Auxiliary carry. The 8080 encoded all instructions in a single bype (including register-numbers, but excluding immediates) for simplicity. Sometimes instructions are followed by a few bytes for an immediate operand, memory address, or port number.

####**Instruction Format Comparisons** – Pick two instructions: Pick a branch instruction and one other instruction. Compare the assembly and machine code format for both of these instructions among all 4 processors.

* beq instruction (J-type): 
  * assembly:  JNZ HHHLLL
  * machine:   C2 LL HH
  * operation: Jump if not zero/equal to LLL,HHH
* add instruction (R-type):
  * assembly:  ANA B
  * machine:   A0
  * operation: [A]+[B]


#Modern General Purpose MIPS Architecture

**Major Components:**
  * PC (program counter)
  * Instruction Memory
  * Register File
  * ALU (arithmetic and logic unit)
  * memory
  * Control Unit

The processor starts by fetching instruction from memory. The instruction is then sent to the register file, in which bits 25-21 are connected to the address input of one of the register file read ports. Instruction bits 15 down to 0 are sign-extended (or zero-extended by later implementation and depending on the instruction type) to 32 bits. An ALU is ready to receive two operands, a SrcA, from the register file, and SrcB, which comes from the sign-extended immediate. An ALU Control determines the operation to be used. The outcome of this ALU is ALUResult, is then sent to the Data Memory. From here, the data is read from data memory onto a ReadData bus, which is written back to the destination register in the register file. During this process and cycling, the processor must compute the address of the next instruction, thus another adder is implemented to increment the program counter by 4. Another bus known as WriteData, is also sent to Data Memory if there is a store operation. As a result, ReadData is ignored. Adding basic instructions such as add, sub, an, or, and slt require datapath enhancements involving more muxes to determine which type of instruction is being used and which should be entered into the ALU. A memory to register mux is also available to determine whether or not ReadData or ALUResult is active. Other instructions yet again, such as branch and jump require additional datapath enhancements as well. A control unit computes the control signals based on the opcode and funct fields of the instruction bits. Based on the instruction specified, this CU controls the muxes within the datapath. Within the control unit contains the main decoder and ALU decoder. 

Weaknesses: 
  * Requires long clock cycle to support slowest instruction
  * Requires three adders (expensive)
  * Separate instruction and data memoreis (unrealistic)

####**Instruction Format Comparisons** – Pick two instructions: Pick a branch instruction and one other instruction. Compare the assembly and machine code format for both of these instructions among all 4 processors.

* beq instruction (J-type): 
  * assembly:  beq rs, rt, label
  * machine:   [opcode (6 bits)][RS (5 bits)][RT (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]
  * operation: if ([rs]==[rt]) PC=JTA (jump target address)
* add instruction (R-type):
  * assembly:  add rd, rs, rt 
  * machine:   [op (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][shamt (5 bits)][funct (6 bits)]
						op, shamt = 0, funct = 100000
  * operation: [rd]=[rs]+[rt]

#Modern Application Specific Nvidia Fermi Architecture

####**Data Path Units** – Write a paragraph describing the Data Path Unit architecture for each processor. How do the DPUs compare one to another?

Fermi is a GPU architecture created by Nvidia and was used as the primary microarchitecture for their GeForce 400 & GeForce 500 series of GPU’s. From what can be gathered from a multitude of resources across the internet that all communicate similarly vague information on the DPU of Fermi microarchitecture, the DPU is as follows: instructions are loaded onto an instruction cache, where they are then passed on to two warp schedulers. From the warp schedulers, a dispatch unit sends the information to a register file, where the data can then flow to four options: either block of 16 cores, a single block of 16 ld/store units (load/store), or to a single block of special function units. Data can then be sent to shared memory.

Weaknesses:
  * High-power consumption (244 Watts) compared to Kepler (other microarchitecture used in GPU’s
  * Loud
  * Doesn’t permit double-precision instructions to be paired with other instructions
